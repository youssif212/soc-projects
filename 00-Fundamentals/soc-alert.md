# SOC Alert Properties Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the core properties of security alerts as handled within a Security Operations Center (SOC). It is intended for portfolio demonstration purposes and reflects practical SOC workflows, terminology, and analyst responsibilities.

---

## 1. Alert Time

**Description:**
Indicates when the alert was generated by the security system. Alert time is often slightly later than the actual event time due to processing and correlation delays.

**Why It Matters:**
Understanding the delay between event time and alert time helps analysts assess attacker dwell time and investigation urgency.

**Example:**

* Alert Time: March 21, 15:35
* Event Time: March 21, 15:32

---

## 2. Alert Name

**Description:**
Provides a concise summary of the detected activity, typically derived from the detection rule name.

**Why It Matters:**
Helps analysts quickly understand the nature of the alert and prioritize investigation.

**Examples:**

* Unusual Login Location
* Email Marked as Phishing
* Windows RDP Bruteforce
* Potential Data Exfiltration

---

## 3. Alert Severity

**Description:**
Defines the urgency and potential impact of the alert. Severity is initially set by detection engineers and may be adjusted by SOC analysts after triage.

**Why It Matters:**
Severity drives prioritization, escalation paths, and response timelines.

**Severity Levels:**

* 🟢 Low / Informational
* 🟡 Medium / Moderate
* 🟠 High / Severe
* 🔴 Critical / Urgent

---

## 4. Alert Status

**Description:**
Indicates the current state of the alert within the investigation lifecycle.

**Why It Matters:**
Prevents duplicate work and provides visibility into SOC workload and progress.

**Common Statuses:**

* 🆕 New / Unassigned
* 🔄 In Progress / Pending
* ✅ Closed / Resolved
* Custom statuses depending on SOC processes

---

## 5. Alert Verdict (Classification)

**Description:**
Defines whether the alert represents a genuine security threat or benign activity.

**Why It Matters:**
Accurate classification improves detection quality, reduces alert fatigue, and supports threat intelligence metrics.

**Common Verdicts:**

* 🔴 True Positive – Confirmed threat
* 🟢 False Positive – Benign or expected behavior
* Additional verdicts may include: Benign Positive, Suspicious, or Needs Tuning

---

## 6. Alert Assignee

**Description:**
Identifies the SOC analyst responsible for investigating and resolving the alert.

**Why It Matters:**
Ensures accountability and clear ownership throughout the alert lifecycle.

**Notes:**

* Assignee may also be referred to as *Alert Owner*
* Analysts can self-assign or be assigned by a lead

---

## 7. Alert Description

**Description:**
Provides detailed context explaining why the alert was generated and how it should be investigated.

**Typical Sections:**

1. Detection rule logic
2. Why the activity may indicate malicious behavior
3. Optional triage and investigation guidance

**Why It Matters:**
Helps analysts make faster, more accurate decisions—especially during high alert volume.

---

## 8. Alert Fields

**Description:**
Displays the specific data points and analyst notes related to the alert trigger.

**Why It Matters:**
Provides the technical evidence required for investigation and decision-making.

**Examples:**

* Affected Hostname
* Username
* Source IP Address
* Entered Command Line
* File Hashes
* Analyst Comments

---

## Conclusion

These alert properties form the foundation of effective SOC operations. Proper understanding and usage enable analysts to triage alerts efficiently, reduce false positives, and respond quickly to real threats. This documentation demonstrates familiarity with real-world SOC alert handling and investigative workflows.
