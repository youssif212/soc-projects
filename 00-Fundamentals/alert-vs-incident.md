Alert vs Incident



An alert is a notification generated by a security tool when suspicious

activity is detected. Alerts do not always mean that an attack is happening.



An incident is a confirmed security event that has been investigated and

validated as malicious or harmful.



Not all alerts become incidents. One of the main responsibilities of a SOC

analyst is to analyze alerts and decide whether they are false positives or

real incidents.
