Alert vs Incident



An alert is a notification generated by a security tool when suspicious

activity is detected. Alerts do not always mean that an attack is happening.



An incident is a confirmed security event that has been investigated and

validated as malicious or harmful.



Not all alerts become incidents. One of the main responsibilities of a SOC

analyst is to analyze alerts and decide whether they are false positives or

real incidents.


## **Practical Example:**
**Alert:** SIEM generates alert "Multiple Failed Logins from Unusual Country"
- **Action:** Analyst investigates login attempts
- **Finding:** Legitimate user traveling for work
- **Verdict:** ✅ False Positive (Closed)

**Incident:** EDR alerts "PowerShell Execution with Obfuscated Commands"
- **Action:** Analyst investigates, finds living-off-the-land attack
- **Finding:** Credential theft and lateral movement detected
- **Verdict:** 🔴 True Positive (Escalate to Incident Response)
